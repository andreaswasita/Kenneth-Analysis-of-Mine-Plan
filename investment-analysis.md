## 8. Strategic Options Review (SOR) Findings

The SOR commenced mid-2025 and has already delivered material improvements:

| Finding | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **West wall steepening** | Overall slope angle increased from ~40° to ~50°. Factor of safety ~2.0 (industry norm 1.3). Significantly reduces strip ratio. |
| **Underground replaces deep open-pit** | No need to relocate processing plants. CY25 ORE has **~30% lower strip ratio** vs CY24. |
| **Improved pit staging** | Stable ore streams to current plants |
| **Potential throughput increases** | Under investigation — could lift production further |
| **TRP conversion to hard-rock** | Investigation of converting TRP to hard-rock SC6 plant, materially lifting production for modest capex |

---

## 9. Bull Case (Reasons TO Invest)

| Factor | Supporting Evidence |
|--------|---------------------|
| **World-class, long-life asset** | 28-year LoM with 457 Mt MRE and 176 Mt ORE. Tier-1 globally. |
| **Strip ratio dramatically improved** | CY25 strip ratio 3.8x, down ~30% from CY24. West wall steepening provides further upside. |
| **Underground optionality (NEW)** | First underground MRE: 132 Mt at 1.5% Li₂O (32 Mt in situ SC6). Previously NOT reported. Extends mine life beyond open-pit. |
| **Stable, predictable production** | >1.6 Mt SC6/year for 20+ years. Peaks >2 Mt/a in 2029. |
| **Very low-cost producer** | Talison described as "very low-cost producer" resilient to price volatility. Breakeven grade 0.43% Li₂O. |
| **Secured off-take** | 100% sold to Tianqi and Albemarle. No sales or marketing risk. |
| **CGP3 ramp-up** | New plant reaching nameplate 2026. Debottlenecking to lift combined production by 2028. |
| **MRE growing** | Total MRE up 4% mass and 9% contained lithia YoY despite mining depletion. |
| **Model-to-mill reconciliation** | MRE precisely predicts contained lithia (136.2 kt actual vs 136.5 kt MRE). 99.8% accuracy. |
| **SOR upside** | Wall steepening, throughput improvements, TRP conversion — multiple catalysts not yet in estimates. |
| **Proven infrastructure** | 40+ years of operations. All infrastructure in place. 5 processing plants. Port access at Bunbury. |
| **Strong environmental/social standing** | No known environmental impediments. All approvals in place. Strong community relationships. |

---

## 10. Bear Case (Reasons NOT to Invest)

| Factor | Risk Detail |
|--------|-------------|
| **Peak material movement 2034–2039** | ~50 Mt/a sustained over 6 years. Mining costs increase to A$32/m³ by 2040 as depth increases. |
| **Massive LoM capex** | ~A$4B+ total: TSF5 alone is ~A$2B, waste dumps A$350M, closure A$425M. Funding risk for JV. |
| **Lithium price exposure** | NPV "most sensitive to changes in product price, exchange rates and sales volumes." Lithium prices remain volatile. |
| **Grade degradation in tail** | Li₂O drops from 2.22% peak to 1.19% post-mining. Lower grades = higher cost per tonne of SC6. |
| **Underground MRE is all Inferred** | Cannot be converted to ORE yet. No underground mining included in LoM schedule. Still conceptual. |
| **JV complexity** | IGO holds only 24.99% — limited operational control. Decisions made by Tianqi (majority) and Albemarle. |
| **Water supply risk** | "Sufficient water supply for processing is a production risk." Additional dams needed. |
| **Tailings storage** | TSF4 provides only ~10 more years. TSF5 requires ~A$2B and regulatory approval. |
| **Post-2049 cliff** | Production collapses rapidly after mining ceases. Stockpile feed only from 2049–2053. |
| **Mining cost escalation** | Load and haul unit costs nearly double from ~A$15/m³ to ~A$32/m³ between 2026 and 2048. |
| **Ore-sorting technology risk** | ~30 Mt of contaminated ore requires ore-sorting tech "yet to be implemented." Assumed 50% mass recovery at 2× grade. |
| **Central Lode MRE decline** | Open-pit Central Lode MRE down 31% (116 Mt less than CY24), partially offset by underground reassignment. |

## 11. Financial Dynamics by Phase

| Phase | Period | Revenue Drivers | Cost Pressures | Net Outlook |
|-------|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Ramp-up** | 2026–2029 | CGP3 ramp, peak SC6 >2 Mt/a, high grades (2.1–2.2% Li₂O) | CGP3 capex completion | **Strong positive cashflow** |
| **Peak mining** | 2030–2039 | Stable 1.6–2.0 Mt/a SC6 | Peak movement ~50 Mt/a, rising unit costs, TSF5 construction starts (~A$2B) | **Margin compression, high capex** |
| **Mature** | 2040–2048 | Stable processing, declining movement | Mining costs at A$32/m³, grade declining | **Moderate cashflow** |
| **Tail** | 2049–2053 | Stockpile feed only, 0.1–0.4 Mt/a SC6 | Low throughput, 1.19% Li₂O grade, closure costs A$425M | **Likely cash-negative** |

## 12. Valuation Considerations

### IGO's 24.99% Share of Key LoM Metrics

| Metric | 100% Basis | IGO's 24.99% Share |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| ORE tonnes | 176 Mt | 44 Mt |
| In situ SC6 | 55 Mt | 13.7 Mt |
| LoM mining cost | A$6,106M | A$1,526M |
| LoM processing cost | A$8,296M | A$2,074M |
| LoM G&A | A$2,327M | A$582M |
| LoM total capex | ~A$4,023M | ~A$1,006M |
| LoM royalties | A$4,227M | A$1,057M |

### Key Ratios

| Ratio | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Strip ratio (CY25 ORE) | 3.8 (down from ~5.4 in CY24) |
| MRE to ORE conversion | ~38% (176 Mt ORE / 457 Mt MRE) |
| Underground MRE as % of total | 29% (132 Mt / 457 Mt) — all optionality |
| ORE grade vs breakeven | 1.9% vs 0.43% — **4.4x margin of safety** |
| Model reconciliation (lithia) | 99.8% accuracy (136.2 kt actual vs 136.5 kt model) |

---

## 13. Verdict

| | |
|---|---|
| **Investable?** | **YES — Materially stronger case than before the ASX release.** |
| **Risk rating** | **Medium** (downgraded from Medium-High due to lower strip ratio, underground optionality, and secured off-take) |
| **Time horizon** | 5–10+ year patient capital |
| **Key catalysts** | CGP3 nameplate (2026), SC6 peak (2029), SOR outcomes (2026), lithium price recovery |

### What Changed My View (vs. prior analysis based on Figure 14 alone)

1. **Strip ratio 30% lower than CY24** — the 2034 waste campaign is less severe than previously assumed.
2. **Underground MRE exists** — 132 Mt at 1.5% Li₂O is a game-changer for mine life extension. Not in LoM yet = pure upside.
3. **Breakeven grade is 0.43% Li₂O** — The mine is profitable well below average feed grade. 4.4x grade margin of safety.
4. **Secured off-take** — 100% sold to Tianqi and Albemarle. No sales or marketing risk.
5. **"Very low-cost producer"** — Talison's positioning means it survives downturns others don't.
6. **Model reconciliation is exceptional** — 99.8% accuracy on contained lithia. This is rare for a resource estimate.

### Remaining Concerns

1. **~A$2B TSF5 construction** — Largest single capex item. Approval and construction execution risk.
2. **Lithium price** — Still the biggest variable. NPV sensitivity is highest to price and FX.
3. **IGO's 24.99% minority stake** — Limited control, limited ability to influence capital allocation.
4. **Ore-sorting technology** — ~30 Mt of contaminated ore depends on unproven (at this site) technology.

## 14. Bottom Line

> Greenbushes is the **best hard-rock lithium asset globally** with a 28-year mine life, 457 Mt MRE, secured off-take, very low breakeven, and now underground optionality. The CY25 ASX release materially de-risks the investment case: strip ratio is 30% lower, an underground MRE provides extension upside, and the model reconciles with 99.8% accuracy.
>
> As a fund manager, I would **invest** at current or lower price levels with a 5–10 year hold thesis. The key risk is lithium price volatility, but Greenbushes' low-cost position means it is one of the last mines to become unprofitable in a downturn. I would size the position to reflect IGO's 24.99% minority interest and hedge lithium exposure.
>
> **Entry discipline is critical.** Buy on weakness, not strength. The 2034–2039 peak mining period creates a window of elevated capex that the market may overreact to.
